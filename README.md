# Mystery Word

### Do you love 'hangman' word games?

#### System Requirements

* Must have dictionary at **/usr/share/dict/words** on your system. Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X users should have this on their system by default.

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* To run this program, save `mystery_word.py` to your computer. Using a command-line program (such as Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file and run the following line to play: `python3 mystery_word.py`

#### Game Description
Much like hangman, you guess letters in an effort to uncover the word. Blanks are represented by an underscore. You have only 8 guesses, but if you select a letter that is in the word, you do not lose a guess.

##### A word about the dictionary
The words used in this game are from web2 (Webster's Second International) dictionary, copyright 1934. The copyright has lapsed, and thus in the public domain. Keep an open mind and get ready to learn some new words as you play!
